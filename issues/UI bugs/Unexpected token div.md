# Unexpected token div - JSX Syntax Error

## Issue Log

| Timestamp | Method of Fixing | Result |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| 2025-01-22 14:30 | Initial diagnosis: Suspected complex conditional structure with WPR condition placed after fallback. Removed entire data extraction interface section (lines 1259-1451) and changed `) : null}` to `)}` | ❌ Failed - Error persists at line 685 |
| 2025-01-22 14:40 | User manually fixed: Added `) : null}` on line 1404. Previously was `)}`. The conditional structure needed a final fallback case. | ✅ Success - Build compiles without errors |
